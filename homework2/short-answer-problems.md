# Short Answer Solutions

## Problem 1:
The Stream Paradigm, which is built on TCP is used for 1-to-1 connections. The Message Paradigm is built on UDP and is for multiple connections.

## Problem 2:
- Connection oriented
- Uses 1-to-1 communication
- Uses sequence of individual bytes
- Length of transfer is arbitrary
- Used in many applications
- Built on TCP

## Problem 3:
- Connectionless
- Many-to-mant communication
- Uses sequence of messages
- Each message must be less than 64Kbs
- Used widely in multimedia
- Built on UDP

## Problem 4:
The stream paradigm does not restrict block size.

## Problem 5:
The message paradigm because it allows for multiple connections.

## Problem 6:

## Problem 7:

## Problem 9:

## Problem 10:
A server is a program that continuously waits for connection, not the physical machine that is running the program. A server-class computer is a machine that is built to run one or more servers.

## Problem 11:
Yes, but the server send the initial message and waits for the client's connection.

## Problem 12:

## Problem 13:

## Problem 14:
The IP identifies the computer on which the server is running. The port number specifies the service.

## Problem 15:
